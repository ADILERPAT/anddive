Building ScubaLib from source requires a basic working knowledge of
compiling Java projects on your system and using a command line (DOS or Unix).

Dependencies
------------
You will need the following software tools to build Core:
- A JDK compatible with Java 1.6 or later (Oracle, OpenJDK, Blackdown, etc.)
- Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)

Code Dependencies
-----------------
- Core from my andDive project's SVN: http://code.google.com/p/anddive

See the build instructions included with Core to produce a jar. Then copy or
symlink that jar in the "libs" directory of this project.

Building
--------
Once your environment is set up, you can use ant to
compile the project. On a command line in the top-level Core directory,
type "ant" to build a jar that will be placed in "build/ScubaLib.jar"
