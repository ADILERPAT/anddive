Building android_common from source requires a basic working knowledge of
compiling Java projects on your system and using a command line (DOS or Unix).

Dependencies
------------
You will need the following software tools to build Gas Mixer:
- A JDK compatible with Java 1.6 or later and the Android Tools (Oracle,
  OpenJDK, Blackdown, etc.)
- Google Android SDK (http://developer.android.com/sdk)
- Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)

Code Dependencies
-----------------
- Core from my andDive project's SVN: http://code.google.com/p/anddive

See the build instructions included with Core to produce a jar. Then copy or
symlink that jar in the "libs" directory of this project.

Building
--------
Once your environment is set up, you can use Ant to compile the project. On a
command line in the top-level Gas Mixer directory, type "ant compile".
