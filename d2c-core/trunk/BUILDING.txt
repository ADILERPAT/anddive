Building Core from source requires a basic working knowledge of
compiling Java projects on your system and using a command line (DOS or Unix).

Dependencies
------------
You will need the following software tools to build Core:
- A JDK compatible with Java 1.6 or later (Oracle, OpenJDK, Blackdown, etc.)
- Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)

Code Dependencies
-----------------
There are no code dependencies in this library.

Building
--------
Once your environment is set up, you can use ant to
compile the project. On a command line in the top-level Core directory,
type "ant" to build a jar that will be placed in "build/Core.jar"
